This is a collection of python3.x utility modules. I am not making any attempt to keep it portable or free of other dependents.

General Notes:
~Where appropriate, a module will be executable direct from the command line using "default" behavior. This is achieved using "if __name__=='__main__'" type logic at the end of a file.
~All modules are imported as part of the package (see __init__.py).

Known Dependencies:
~standard python libraries
~ROOT (must be compiled using python3 libraries, this means by hand for now)

Wishlist:
~LinearInterp(x_values, y_values, DesiredXs=False, DesiredYs=False): function taking a list of x and y values (min of 2 each, optionally more) and computes a least squares best fit line and computes value of Y at <DesiredXs> and the value of X at <DesiredYs>. Returns the two fit parameters (with uncertainties if a fit) and if points were requested, the values at those points (with optional uncertainties?).
