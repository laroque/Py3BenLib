This is a collection of python3.x utility modules. I am not making any attempt to keep it portable or free of other dependents.

General Notes:
~Where appropriate, a module will be executable direct from the command line using "default" behavior. This is achieved using "if __name__=='__main__'" type logic at the end of a file.
~All modules are imported as part of the package (see __init__.py).

Known Dependencies:
~standard python libraries
~ROOT (must be compiled using python3 libraries, this means by hand for now)
